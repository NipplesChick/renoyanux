        <p>
          A Decision Tree classification project in this context aims to build a model that can predict which salary bracket an employee at PT Zuresha Hitoma Jakarta belongs to, based on various features about them. Target Variable (The
          Salary): This is the variable we want to predict. For classification, the numerical salary must be converted into discrete classes (e.g., salary $\le$ IDR 5 million, IDR 5-10 million, IDR $\ge$ 10 million). Features (Predictor
          Variables): These are the attributes that influence the salary. Common features include: Years of Experience: (e.g., 3 years, 10 years), Education Level: (e.g., Bachelor's, Master's, Diploma), Job Title/Department: (e.g.,
          Engineer, HR Staff, Manager), Age, Performance Rating: (e.g., Excellent, Good, Average), Location in Jakarta: (if relevant).
        </p>

        <div class="collapse-body">
          <p>
            A Decision Tree works by repeatedly splitting the data into subsets based on the features that provide the most information gain or purity regarding the target variable (salary class). Structure: It resembles a flowchart or a
            tree with three main components: Root Node: Represents the entire dataset (all 187 employees), Internal Nodes: Represent a test on an attribute (a feature), e.g., "Is Experience > 5 years?", Leaf Nodes: Represent the final
            classification result (the predicted salary class), e.g., 'High Salary.'
          </p>
          <p>This analysis helps the company ensure fairness and consistency in their compensation structure, identifying the key attributes that drive salary decisions within the 187 employees surveyed.</p>

          Increase Liquidity: To allow previously illiquid assets (like real estate) to be traded fractionally (in parts) and easily on the global market, Reduce Costs and Settlement Time: Asset transactions can be completed quickly
          peer-to-peer, eliminating the need for expensive intermediaries, Enhance Transparency: All ownership and transfers can be audited and verified on the blockchain.

          The main objectives are to Increase Liquidity by allowing fractional, global trading of assets like property, to Reduce Costs and Settlement Time by enabling fast peer-to-peer transactions, and to Enhance Transparency since all

        <p>
          At university, in addition to my computer science subjects, I completed a number of architecture and design electives. In one of my favourite architecture subjects we had to design and 3D print a pavilion using parametric tools
          and present it in VR with Unreal Engine. I programmatically modeled a magnetic field and extracted the field lines to inform the structure of my pavilion. I enjoyed this assignment so much I decided to extend myself and produce a
          number of 3D ray traced renders some of which are below. My design received first class honors and was chosen to be exhibited in the prestigious Melbourne School of Design annual exhibition (MSDx).

          implement a real time lighting and particle engine from scratch. The engine was capable of handling different lights at different intensities, intersecting shadows and a large number of shadow casting game objects.

          ships. It was published on the App Store and Play Store and remained there for a number of years (before I got tired of paying Apple's developer fee) and even netted a few thousand downloads.

          When I was 12 years old, I played a lot of Minecraft however, I was never very happy with the low resolution look of the game. I decided to remedy this by creating a texture pack, which is a file containing alternative looks or
          textures for the objects in the game. When I put my work online, after some refinement I received my first 1000 downloads. Spotting a business opportunity, I added ads to the download link. My texture pack was downloaded over
          50,000 times, earning me a few hundred dollars.

        <p>
          Below is one of my earliest creations dating back to 2010. As a budding 10 year old web designer I needed a website to showcase my work and attract “clients”, so I made one! I called it EdSites and registered the domain name
          edsites.biz with my father’s credit card and got to work. All the HTML, CSS and even the JavaScript was written completely by hand by me. The website was such a success that it resulted in some clients albeit they were all my
          family members.

        <div class="image">
          <img src="/src/img/edsites.png" width="100%" alt="EdSites screenshot" loading="lazy" style="aspect-ratio: 1769 / 1229" />
        </div> -->
        <!-- <hr /> -->
        <p>What you see here is merely a glimpse into my extensive portfolio of projects over the years. I possess a wealth of additional personal and professional work.</p>
